# Overview and Motivation

### Motivation

We all want our parents and loved ones to recieve the best medical coverage possible. My parents are 2 years away from Medicare eligibility, and I want to take a data driven approach to finding which health insurance organizations provide the best service by analyzing Star Ratings Measurements. Medicare Part C is a program administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that combines Medicare Parts A and B (traditional Medicare) and optionally Part D (Prescription Drug Plan) through which beneficiaries recieve coverage through private insurance companies (United, Aetna, Humana, etc.) These insurance companies often offer greater benefits than what is offered through traditional Medicare, so it can be appealing to certain people based on their coverage needs. Enrollment in Medicare Part C has increased every year since 2005 and currently, approximately 34% of Medicare Benficiaries get their coverage through Part C^[https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/a-dozen-facts-about-medicare-advantage-in-2019/]

### Overview

CMS assigns the insurance contracts Category Star Ratings between 1-5 for various categories such as "Staying Healthy: Screenings, Tests and Vaccines" and "Managing Chronic (Long Term) Conditions." These categories are aggregated up to give a plan one final Star Rating. These insurance companies deeply care about having a higher Star Rating because they are rewarded lucrative benefits such as increased revenue and a longer enrollment period. Each of the Category Star Ratings is determined by sub-measures such as "Colorectal Cancer Screening," "Controlling Blood Pressure," and "Rheumatoid Arthritis Management."

It is these sub-measures that we will be analyzing because it is precisely these sub-measures which can give us insight into how these plans are performing.

# Initial Questions

There are three main questions (each with several sub-questions and paths we could go down) that we want to tackle:

* Are there certain insurance companies that perform better among certain measures? Which companies and which measures?

* Does the size of the enrollment in the contract play an impact in measures?

* For a person with specific needs due to a chronic condition, which plan features and/or organizations are the best choice to manage that condition?


# Data

There are three main data sets we are going to be pulling from:

* Enrollment information for Medicare Part C plans

* Contract information for Medicare Part C plans

* Star Rating data for Medicare Part C plans.

All of these data are publicly available through the CMS website^[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/PerformanceData]. Initially the data seemed extremely messy with lots of missing values, but after a thorough investigation of the data it became much clearer. There are lots of smaller organizations with small and/or new contracts, and thus, the reporting requirements are more lenient. However, if we only consider contracts with >10,000 total enrollment and exclude certain specific plans (Demos and employer specific) the data is much cleaner while still covering 95% of total enrollment. Ultimately, when it comes to dealing with missing data, something has to give and unless you can develop imputation methods (impossible in this circumstance) we have to take what we are given. Furthermore, missing a few small/obscure contracts will not change the nature of the information, as this nice pie-chart from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows market dominance by the major players:

### Data Importing and Joining.

Cleaning and organizing the data was not too intense. We had to recode a few values, perform some joins to get all the data together, and clean up values that were not reported and present them as NA so that R could digest them appropriately. Most of the cleaning is actually done in the Analysis section because it was more prudent to clean the data on an ad hoc basis depending on which analysis we were trying to perform, and also maintaining the most data we can.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

#Read in Enrollment data
data_main<- read_csv("C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Desktop\\MPC data\\CPSC_Enrollment_2019_09\\CPSC_Enrollment_Info_2019_09.csv")
data_main$enr= ifelse(data_main$Enrollment=='*',0,as.numeric(data_main$Enrollment))
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Read in contract Information
contract_info = read_csv("C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Desktop\\MPC data\\CPSC_Enrollment_2019_09\\CPSC_Contract_Info_2019_09.csv")

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Read in Star Ratings data
SR = read_csv("C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Desktop\\MPC data\\2018_Report_Card_Master_Table_2018_03_28_data_DW.csv")

```


```{r}
#Get enrollment by contract number
enrollment_data=data_main %>%
  group_by(`Contract Number`) %>%
  summarize(tot_enr=sum(enr)) %>%
  mutate(contract=`Contract Number`)
```

```{r}
#Get Unique contract information.
cntrct=contract_info %>%
  select(`Contract ID`,`Organization Type`, `Parent Organization`,`Contract Effective Date`)%>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(contract=`Contract ID`)
  
```


```{r}
#Inner join data
#EXCLUDE PLANS THAT ARE JUST PD, and where enrollment is 0
main_enr_data=inner_join(enrollment_data,cntrct, by='contract')%>%
  filter(`Organization Type` !='Medicare Prescription Drug Plan') %>%
  filter(tot_enr>0)
```

```{r}
#inner join SR data

SR2=SR%>%
  mutate(contract=CONTRACT_ID)%>%
  select (-c(`Organization Type`, `Parent Organization`))
full_data=inner_join(main_enr_data,SR2,by='contract')

#also create sub filter where enrollment is  > 10000.
#Also remove demo plans and employer specific plans (no data)
enr_10000=full_data %>%
  filter(tot_enr>10000) %>%
  filter(`Organization Type` !='Demo') %>%
  filter(`Organization Type` !='Employer/Union Only Direct Contract PDP')
#note this is still 95% of all enrollment so we are not missing much.
sum(enr_10000$tot_enr)/sum(full_data$tot_enr)
```


# Data Analysis

Manual inspection of the measures taken help us focus in on the specific questions we want to answer. To cover a broad range of categories/questions we will consider the following measures:


### **Measure of overall effectiveness**

* **Members Choosing to Leave the Plan:** This is not a perfect measure, as some areas have less plans operating in them, but seeing as how traditional Medicare is always an option, this measure should give information of how satisfied plan beneficiaries are.

* **Rating of Health Care Quality:** It is obvious why this is important.

* **Rating of Health Plan:** It is obvious why this is important.

* **Getting Needed Care:** Again, obvious why it's important.

### **Measures for Diabetes Care**

* **Diabetes Care - Eye Exam**

* **Diabetes Care - Kidney Disease Monitoring**

* **Diabetes Care - Blood Sugar Controlled**

* **Medication Adherence for Diabetes Medications.** Note this is only relevent for contracts offering Part D plans.

### **Measures for a person in good health with few/no chronic conditions**

* **Breast Cancer Screening**

* **Colorectal Cancer Screening**

* **Annual Flu Vaccine**

* **Improving or Maintaining Physical Health**

* **Improving or Maintaining Mental Health**

* **Monitoring Physical Activity**

* **Adult BMI Assessment**


We will also asses the **Plan Type, Plan Size, ** and **Parent Organization** to see if these factors have an effect.



Let us first finalize and clean the data.

```{r}
final_data=enr_10000 %>%
  rename(
    BCS=`C01: Breast Cancer Screening`
    ,CCS=`C02: Colorectal Cancer Screening`

         ,DMed)

```



Let us first explore the effect of plan type on overal plan effectiveness by looking at how they perform differently among the **Measures of Overall effectiveness** as noted above.

To do this, we will perform 3 two-sample T-tests for each of the 4 measures comparing Local Coordinated Care Plans (LCCP) with Regional Coordinated Care Plans (RCCP) and with 1876 Cost Plans. Note that all but 1 of the 12 two-sample T-tests show significantly different means at the .05 level with 1876 cost plans performing best, then LCCPs, then RCCPs.

```{r}

Based on the coefficients of the covariates and their p values we can say that generally a larger and older Medicare Contract will provide better diabetes care.


Now Let us do some regressions on the same covariates but looking at overall measures for healthy adults.

Similar to with the diabetes measures, we can see that although for some measures the age and size of the contract is not a statistically significant predictor, it usually is, and it is the case the a larger/older contract performs better because of the sign of the coefficients.

Lastly, let's compare the three major private insurance players in this space that control over half of the market, United Health Group, Humana, and CVS (Aetna) using the measures for overall quality.

```{r}
Priv_data1= final_data %>%
  filter(`Parent Organization`=='UnitedHealth Group, Inc.'
         | `Parent Organization`=='Humana Inc.'
         | `Parent Organization`=='CVS Health Corporation')%>%
     filter(Leave != "Plan too new to be measured" & Leave !="Not enough data available" & Leave !="Plan too small to be measured" )%>%
  mutate(Leave=as.numeric(substr(Leave,1,nchar(Leave)-1)))%>%

  mutate(GetCare=as.numeric(GetCare))%>%
  mutate(uhg=ifelse(`Parent Organization`=='UnitedHealth Group, Inc.',1,0))%>%
  mutate(hum=ifelse(`Parent Organization`=='Humana Inc.',1,0))%>%
  mutate(cvs=ifelse(`Parent Organization`=='CVS Health Corporation',1,0))

```



```{r}
#Linear regression, letting UHG be the "base" category, but adding Humana/CVS as comparison categories

lm1=lm(Leave~hum+cvs,data=Priv_data1)
lm2=lm(Quality~hum+cvs,data=Priv_data2)
lm3=lm(PlanRating~hum+cvs,data=Priv_data3)
lm4=lm(GetCare~hum+cvs,data=Priv_data4)

summary(lm1)
summary(lm2)
summary(lm3)
summary(lm4)

confint(lm1)
confint(lm2)
confint(lm3)
confint(lm4)

```

Based on the results of these simple regressions, no major conclusions can be made about the quality of care based on which of the major insurers you choose, because some insurers perform better than other in various overall quality measures.
